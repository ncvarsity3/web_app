'''
This is my first attempt at creating a Django web app.
I first cloned the "https://github.com/ncvarsity3/web_app" repository from my personal GitHub account.
Then created a virtual environment to save my dependencies "python3 -m venv .venv".
I stored my dependencies in a requirements file with "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
